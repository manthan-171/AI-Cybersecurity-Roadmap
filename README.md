# 🚀 AI + Cybersecurity Roadmap

Welcome! I'm a B.Tech Computer Science student on a mission to build a powerful, future-ready career by mastering **Artificial Intelligence + Cybersecurity** — two of the most in-demand fields in tech today.

This repository is a live, structured showcase of everything I’m learning, building, and documenting over the next 12+ months.

## 🧠 Why AI + Cybersecurity?

- AI helps analyze vast security data, detect anomalies, and automate responses.
- Cybersecurity protects systems, data, and people from ever-growing threats.
- Together, they form a rare, high-paying, and high-impact skillset.

## 📚 Learning Strategy

- ✅ **Learn by Doing**: Every topic is paired with hands-on code or notes.
- ✅ **Learn in Public**: I’m posting progress on GitHub & LinkedIn regularly.
- ✅ **Build Projects**: Mini and major projects for every major phase.
- ✅ **Stay Consistent**: Even small progress every day = big results over time.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Master core cybersecurity & AI skills
- Build 5+ strong projects with GitHub code + writeups
- Crack a high-quality placement (India, Remote, or Dubai)
- Inspire others to learn in public too!
